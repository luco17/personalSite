title: Flipping "Why" questions

I’ve been reading Chris Voss’s “Never Split the Difference”. It’s got some alpha but I suspect there’s more in KGB agent running manuals that is lost to language differences and cultural bias.

An interesting idea was trying to change _‘why’_ questions to _‘how’_ or _‘what’_ questions. These types of open questions build empathy and understanding between parties. I find this quite hard because I instinctively ask ‘why’. To combat this I’ve formulated some how/what variations to some common “why’s”.

Why: “Why do you think that?”
<br>
What: “What led you think that?”
<br>
How: “How did you conclude that?”

Why: “Why did you do that?”
<br>
What: “What made you do that?”
<br>
How: “How did you come to do that?”

Why: “Why are you shaking your head?”
<br>
What: “What’s making you shake your head?”
<br>
How: "How are you feeling about what was just said?"

Why: “Why don’t you call them?”
<br>
What: “What’s stopping you from ringing?”
<br>
How: “How could you get to a state where you’re comfortable ringing them?”

Why: “Why not?”
<br>
What: “What’s holding you back?”
<br>
How: “How would you prefer to approach this?”

I ran some of these on Claude and got some excellent responses. Here’s my prompt:

> You're an expert at discussions, de-escalation and negotiation.

> I'm trying to avoid 'why' questions and replace them with 'what' or 'how' questions. Can you review some 'why's' and substitute them with 'what' and 'how' ones?
