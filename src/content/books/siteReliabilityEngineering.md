There's a lot to cover in this book. It's a good read that gives some insight into how Google manage their phenomenal computing workloads and principles for getting development and ops teams to work closer together. I have historically been prone to getting swept away by ideas in books like this but fortunately my colleague Tom often reminds me "Google can do it because they have over 10k engineers, we have 4!"
