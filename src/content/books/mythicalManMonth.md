Interesting stuff but I think his report for the "Defense Science Board" is a better read. Link [here](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA188561.pdf)

1. The accumulation of simultaneious and interacting factors brings slower and slower motion.

2. Deep within, we want others to user our work and to find it helpful.

3. When schedule slippage is recognized, the natural (and traditional) response is to add manpower. Like dousing a fire with gasoline, this makes matters worse, much worse. More fire requires more gasoline, and thus begins a regenerative cycle which ends in disaster.

4. For the human makers of things, the incompletenesses and inconsistencies of our ideas become clear only during implementation.

5. Adding people to a project creates two burdens: training and intercommunication. Ways of communicating can be calculated by the formula N(N-1)/2

6. Brooks's Law: "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later"

7. Discipline is good for art. Indeed, an artist's aphorism asserts, "Form is liberating."

8. In the last analysis the customer is the independent auditor. In the merciless light of real use, every flaw will show.

9. "Experience is a dear teacher, but fools will learn at no other" ~ Poor Richard's Almanac

10. One must say that data for building isolated small programs are not applicable to programming systems products.

    For a program averaging about 3200 words, for example, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant report an average code-plus-debug time of about 178 hours for a single programmer, a figure which would extrapolate to give an annual productivity of 35,800 statements per year. Planning, documentation, testing,
    system integration, and training times must be added. The linear extrapolation of such sprint figures is meaningless. Extrapolation of times for the hundred-yard dash shows that a man can run a mile in under three minutes.

11. A certain small set of documents embodies and expresses much managerial work. The preparation of each one serves as a major occasion for focusing thought and crystallizing discussions that otherwise would wander endlessly.

12. "It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something" ~ Franklin D. Roosevelt.

13. Where a new system concept or new technology is used, one has to build a system to throw away, for even the best planning is not so omniscient as to get it right the first time. Hence _plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow._

14. Both the tractability and the invsibility of the software product expose its builders to perpetual changes in requirements.

15. Structuring an organization for change is much harder than designing a system for change.

16. Rarely will someone lie about milestone progress, if the milestone is so sharp that he can't deceive himself.

More to come.
