1. At university the republican and liberal students repelled him with their bad manners and refusal to duel: ‘their want of breeding in externals and of acquaintance with the forms and manners of good society’, and ‘the extravagance of their political views, based upon a lack of either culture or knowledge of the conditions of life which historical causes had brought into existence... Their ideas gave me the impression of an association between Utopian theories and defective breeding... I returned to Berlin with less liberal opinions than when I quitted it.’

2. Interesting stuff on reluctance to modernise: "During the 1830s the Prussian government had refused to subsidise railways and was reluctant to authorise private railway building. There were many arguments. Railways were seen as a threat to the old order. Joint stock companies would draw capital away from trade and agriculture and depress the price of government bonds. Landowners would lose property. Bureaucrats would lose control. The postal service would lose its monopoly. More government debt would mean more taxes and constitutional concessions." 

3. Palmerston to Commons: ‘There is in nature no power but mind, all else is passive and inert; in human affairs this power is opinion; in political affairs it is public opinion; and he who can grasp this power, with it will subdue the fleshly arm of physical strength, and compel it to work out his purpose... those statesman who know how to avail themselves of the passions, and the interests, and the opinions of mankind, are able to give an ascendancy, and to exercise a sway over human affairs, far out of all proportion greater than belong to the power and resources of the state over which they preside’.

4. "Official decisions do not gain in honesty and moderation by being arrived at collectively; for apart from the fact that, in the case of voting by majority, arithmetic and chance take the place of logical reasoning, that feeling of personal responsibility, in which lies the essential guarantee for the conscientiousness of the decision, is lost directly it comes about by means of anonymous majorities."
