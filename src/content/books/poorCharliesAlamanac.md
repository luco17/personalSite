1. “There is no better teacher than history in determining the future. There are answers worth billions of dollars in a $30 history book."

2. "Instead, he opted to become a living lesson in compounding, eschewing frivolous (defined as 'any') expenditures that might sap the power of his example."

3. "The quotes, talks, and speeches presented here are rooted in the old-fashioned Midwestern values for which Charlie has become known: lifelong learning, intellectual curiosity, sobriety, avoidance of envy and resentment, reliability, learning from the mistakes of others, perseverance, objectivity, willingness to test one's own beliefs, and many more."

4. Repeated many, many times and borrowed from Jacobi: "Invert, always invert."

5. Charlie's son dies when Charlie is 29: "A friend remebers that Charlie would visit his dying son in the hospital and then walk the streets of Pasadena crying." Having a kid now, I can't imagine how awful it must have been and am amazed at those who get through the grief of losing a child.

6. "Father’s ability to Chinese wall off the most intrusive distractions from whatever mental task he was engaged in... accounts as much as anything for his success."

7. "Charlie has made himself into a grandmaster of preparation, patience, discipline, and objectivity... successful investing is simply a by-product of his carefully organized and focused approach to life."

8. "It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric."

9. "Reliability is essential for progress in life... while quantum mechanics is unlearnable for a vast majority, reliability can be learned to great advantage by almost anyone."

10. Some interesting bits about Carl Braun who could build oil refineries on time with great efficiency. More on him [here](https://www.legalevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/262/2018/07/Braun-Management-and-Leadership.pdf)

11. "If you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to do something and you didn’t tell them why, you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if you did it twice."

12. "The psychology of misjudgment, as I call it—is a terribly important thing to learn. There are about 20 little principles... Terribly smart people make totally bonkers mistakes by failing to pay heed to it."

13. "If you’re building a great circular tank, obviously, as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use up in the surface goes up with the square as the cubic volume goes up with the cube. As you increase the dimensions, you can hold a lot more volume per unit area of steel."

14. On specialisation (Charlie's talking about a travel magazine): "We'd have a travel magazine for business travel, so somebody would create one that was addressed solely at corporate travel departments... they didn't have to waste the ink and paper mailing out stuff that corporate travel departments weren't interested in reading. It was a more efficient system... Occasionally, scaling down and intensifying gives you the big advantage. Bigger is not always better."

15. Sam Walton was pretty when he started his first store. On Sam Walton's rise: "You can say, 'Is this a nice way to behave?' Well, capitalism is a pretty brutal place. But I personally think the world is better for having Walmart. I mean you can idealise small town life, but I've spent a fair amount of time in small towns. And let me tell you - you shouldn't get too idealistic about all those businesses he destroyed. Plus, a lot of people who work at Walmart are very high grade, bouncy people who are raising nice children. I have no feeling that an inferiro culture destroyed a superior culture."

16. On the efficiency of looms in textiles: "He knew that the huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product would all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles... In all cases, the people who sell the machinery - and by and large, even the internal bureaucrats urging you to buy the equipment - show you projections with the amount you'll save at current prices with the new technology. However, they don't do the second stage of the analysis, which is to determine how much is going to stay home and how much is just going to flow through to the customer... So you keep buying things that will pay for themselves in three years. And after 20 years of doing it, somehow you've earned a return of only about 4% per annum."

17. "One of the greatest economists of the world is a substantial shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway and has been from the very early days, after Buffett was in control. His textbook always taught that the stockmarket was perfectly efficient and that nobody could beat it."

18. "it makes sense to load up on the very few good insights you have instead of pretending to know everything about everything at all times."

19. "Anytime somebody offers you a tax shelter form her on in life, my advice would be don't buy it. In fact, anytime anybody offers you anything with a big commission and a 200 page prospectus, don't buy it."

21. Advice for the young: "Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day, and at the end of the day - if you live long enough - like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve."

22. "Some of the worst dysfunctions in business come from the fact that they balkanize reality into little individual departments, with territoriality and turf protection and so forth. So if you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries. You don't have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines."

23. "Ideology does some strange things and distorts cognition terribly. If you get a lot of heavy ideology young, and then you start expressing it, you are really locking your brain into a very unfortunate pattern. And you are going to distort your general cognition."

24. On incentives: "It's very, very important to create human systems that are hard to cheat. Otherwise, you're ruining your civilization, because these big incentives will create incentive-caused bias and people will rationalize that bad behavior is okay. Then, if somebody else does it, now you've got at least two psychological principles: incentive-caused bias plus social proof. Not only that but you get Serpico effects: If enough people are profiting in a general social climate of doing wrong, then they'll turn on you and become dangerous enemies if you try and blow the whistle. It's very dangerous to ignore these principles."

25. More on incentives: "Take the workers' compensation system in California. Stress is real. And its misery can be real. So you want to compensate people for their stress in the workplace. It seems like a noble thing to do. But the trouble with such a compensation practice is that it's practically impossible to delete huge cheating. And once you reward cheating, you get crooked lawyers, crooked doctors, crooked unions, etc. participating in referral schemes. You get a total miasma of disastrous behavior. And the behavior makes all the people doing it worse as they do it. So you were trying to help your civilization, but what you did was create enormous damage, net. _So it's much better to let some things go uncompensated - to let life be hard - than to create systems that are easy to cheat_."

26. "In fact, one trick in life is to get so you can handle mistakes. Failure to handle psychological denial is a common way for people to go broke. You've made an enormous commitment to something. You've poured effort and money in. And the more you put in, the more the whole consistency principle makes you think, 'Now it has to work. If I put in just a little more, then it'll work.'"

27. "You must have the confidence to override people with more credentials than you whose cognition is impaired by incentive-caused bias or some similar psychological force that is obviously present. But there are also cases where you have to recognize that you have no wisdom to add and that your best course is to trust some expert."

28. Jack Welch answering a q. about Apple "Jack, what did Apple do wrong?" - "I don't have any special competence that'd enable me to answer that question."

29. "I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questins about which they don't have any real knowledge."

30. On influencing: "Appealing to interest is likely to work better as a matter of human persuasion than appealing to anything else. That, again, is a powerful psychological principle with deep biological roots."

31. On law firms 'screaming' about legal bills and legal complexity: "what causes the screams has, so far, been a godsend for the law firms. The big law firms have had a long updraft. And they now tend to kind of cluck like an undertaker in a plague. An undertaker, of course, would look very unseemly if he were jumping up and down and playing his fiddle during the plague. So law firm partners say, 'Oh, isn't it sad —all this complexity, all this litigation, all this unfairness.'"

32. "If I were running the civilization, compensation for stress in workers' comp would be zero-not because there's no work-caused stress, but because I think the net social damage of allowing stress to be compensated at all is worse than what would happen if a few people who had real work-caused stress injuries went uncompensated.

    I like the Navy system. If you're a captain in the Navy and you've been up for 24 hours straight and have to go to sleep, and you turn the ship over to a competent first mate in tough conditions and he takes the ship aground, clearly through no fault of yours, they don't court-martial you, but your naval career is over. You can say, 'That's too tough. That's not law school. That's not due process.' Well, the Navy model is better in its context than would be the law school model."

33. "I've always taken a fair amount of time to do what I really wanted to do, some of which was merely to fish or play bridge or play golf. Each of us must figure out his or her own lifestyle. You may want to work 70 hours a week for 10 years to make partner at Cravath and thereby obtain the obligation to do more of the same. Or you may say, 'I'm not willing to pay that price.' Either way, it's a totally personal decision that you have to make by your own lights."

34. "In the last analysis, every profession is a conspiracy against the laity."

35. "After all, a competing product, if it is never tried, can't act as a reward creating a conflicting habit. Every spouse knows that."

36. Think about envy: "We must avoid the bad effects from envy, which is given a prominent place in the Ten Commandments because envy is so much a part of human nature."

37. "The Darwinian approach, with its habitual objectivity taken on as a sort of hair shirt, is a mighty approach indeed. No less a figure than Einstein said that one of the four causes of his achievement was self-criticism, ranking right up there alongside curiosity, concentration, and perseverance."

38. Read Roger Fisher - Getting to Yes [details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_to_Yes).

39. Dr. Johnson: "Truth is hard to assimilate in any mind when opposed by interest".

40. Beware of carefu procedures leading to overconfidence in outcomes.

41. "Your mistaken professors were too much influenced by "rational man" models of human behavior from economics and too little by "foolish man" models from psychology and real-world experience."

42. "The ethical rule is from Samuel Johnson, who believed that maintenance of easily removable ignorance by a responsible officeholder was treacherous malfeasance in meeting moral obligation."
