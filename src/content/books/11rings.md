I had this on my radar for a couple of years along with Alex Ferguson's "Leading". After watching "The Last Dance", it prompted me to get it. It was a very quick, enjoyable read that gives lots of insight into Phil's management style, as well as some of his buddhist and native american inspired methods. I'll write it up properly soon.
