I was given this by the old man for Christmas. It reads like a very long Economist article, if you knew something about economics and business but nothing about tech, then the tech insights are interesting, and conversely if you know something about tech but nothing about economics and business. If you know a bit about both, then there's not much to mine in here. This could be a consequence of Amazon getting so much coverage in the media.

I'll include a couple of interesting quotes when I get time to revisit it.
