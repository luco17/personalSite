This reminded me of the movie [Annihilation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(film)>) by Alex Garland. The essence of both plots is "Mysterious object appears, previous team sent in to investigate hasn't returned, protagonist with a troubled past is sent in as part of new team, the new team experience time/sensory/natural anomalies on the object. Trust breaks down, team members are killed, protagonist reaches the end and confronts alien presence. Returns back forever changed." It keeps the pages turning.
