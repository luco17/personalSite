I started reading this six months ago. It's not long and it's not boring, but it does require serious thinking. The back cover describes it as 'calisthenics for the mind' and that's pretty accurate. The [author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Aguirre) is a physics professor at UC Santa Cruz who came up with the premise of the book after speaking to a zen buddhist colleague. Each chapter opens with a [koan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan) that primes the reader to think about related problems before introducing some physics. The first third is understandable, but rapidly gets abstruse. This is no fault of the author's, it's just complex stuff that requires unpicking lots of what you learnt at school.

I'll write the bits that really hooked me when I get time.
