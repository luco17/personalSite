Fallibilism, the importance of error detection/correction and 'infinite reach'.

1. "Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves." ~ Feynman.

2. Science would be impossible if it were not for the fact that the overwhelming majority of false theories can be rejected out of hand without any experiemnt, simply for being bad explanations.

3. Fallibilism: The recognition that there are no authoritative sources of knowledge, nor any reliable means of justifying knowledge as true or probable.

4. Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow. Or a herd of cows. The universe is not there to overwhelm us; it is our home, and our resource. The bigger the better.

5. Nearly the whole of the Earth's biosphere in its primeval state was likewise incapable of keeping an unprotected human alive for long. It would be much more accurate to call it a death trap for humans rather than a life-support system. Even the Great Rift Valley in eastern Africa, where our species evolved, was barely more hospitable than primeval Oxfordshire. Unlike the life-support system in that imagined spaceship, the Great Rift Valley lacked a safe water supply, and medical equipment, and comfortable living quarters, and was infested with predators, parasites and disease organisms. It frequently injured, poisoned, drenched, starved and sickened its 'passengers', and most of them died as a result.

6. That is the situation to which evolution adapts organisms. And that, therefore, is the lifestyle in which the Earth's biosphere 'seems adapted' to sustaining them. The biosphere only ever achieves stability - and only temporarily at that - by continually neglecting, harming, disabling and killing individuals. Hence the metaphor of a spaceship or a life-support system, is quite perverse: when humans design a life-support system, they design it to provide the maximum possible comfort, safety and longevity for its users within the available resources; the biosphere has no such priorities.

7. Nor is the biosphere a great preserver of species. In addition to being notoriously cruel to individuals, evolution involves continual extinctions of entire species. The average rate of extinction since the beginning of life on Earth has been about ten species per year (the number is known only very approximately), becoming much higher during the relatively brief periods that palaeontologists call mass extinction events'. The rate at which species have come into existence has on balance only slightly exceeded the extinction rate, and the net effect is that the overwhelming majority of species that have ever existed on Earth (perhaps 99.9 per cent of them) are now extinct. Genetic evidence suggests that our own species narrowly escaped extinction on at least one occasion. Several species closely related to ours did become extinct.

   Significantly, the 'life-support system' itself wiped them out - by means such as natural disasters, evolutionary changes in other species, and climate change. Those cousins of ours had not invited extinction by changing their lifestyles or overloading the biosphere: on the contrary, it wiped them out because they were living the lifestyles that they had evolved to live, and in which, according to the Spaceship Earth metaphor, the biosphere had been 'supporting' them.

8. Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth's life-support system for humans' has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene. The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival

   just as the sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and so on. But a heap of raw materials is not the same thing as a life-support system. It takes knowledge to convert the one into the other... the biosphere no more provides humans with a life-support system than it provides us with radio telescopes.

9. In the unique case of humans, the difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on what knowledge they have created.

10. The astrophysicist Martin Rees has speculated that somewhere in the universe 'there could be life and intelligence out there in forms we can't conceive. Just as a chimpanzee can't understand quantum theory, it could be there are aspects of reality that are beyond the capacity of our brains?' But that cannot be so. For if the 'capacity' in question is mere computational speed and amount of memory, then we can understand the aspects in question with the help of computers - just as we have understood the world for centuries with the help of pencil and paper. As Einstein remarked, 'My pencil and I are more clever than I' In terms of computational repertoire, our computers - and brains - are already universal.

11. Problems are inevitable. Problems are soluble.

12. The 'argument from design' has been used for millennia as one of the classic 'proofs' of the existence of God, as follows. Some aspects of the world appear to have been designed, but they were not designed by humans; since "design requires a designer', there must therefore be a God. As I said, that is a bad explanation because it does not address how the knowledge of how to create such designs could possibly have been created. (Who designed the designer?', and so on.)

13. Non-explanatory human knowledge can also evolve in an analogous way: rules of thumb are not passed on perfectly to the next generation of users, and the ones that survive in the long run are not necessarily the ones that optimize the ostensible function. For instance, a rule that is expressed in an elegant rhyme may be remembered, and repeated, better than one that is more accurate but expressed in ungainly prose.

14. Look up _[the difference engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Difference_Engine)_

15. **Infinite regress:** A fallacy in which an argument or explanation depends on a sub-argument of the same form which purports to address essentially the same problem as the original argument.

16. We cannot predict most of the problems that we shall encounter, or most of the opportunities to solve them, let alone the solutions and attempted solutions and how they will affect events. People in 1900 did not consider the internet or nuclear power unlikely: they did not conceive of them at all... Trying to know the unknowable leads inexorably to error and self-deception. Among other things, it creates a bias towards pessimism.

17. Moods do not necessitate any particular stance about the future: the statesman Winston Churchill suffered from intense depression, yet his outlook on the future of civilization, and his specific expectations as wartime leader, were unusually positive. Conversely the economist Thomas Malthus, a notorious prophet of doom (of whom more below), is said to have been a serene and happy fellow, who often had his companions at the dinner table in gales of laughter.

18. Blind optimism is also known as "overconfidence' or 'recklessness'. An often cited example, perhaps unfairly, is the judgement of the builders of the ocean liner Titanic that it was 'practically unsinkable. The largest ship of its day, it sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. Designed to survive every foreseeable disaster, it collided with an iceberg in a manner that had not been foreseen.

19. There is only one way of making progress: conjecture and criticism. And the only moral values that permit sustained progress are the objective values that the enlightenment has begun to discover.

20. Neither Malthus nor Rees intended to prophesy. They were warning that unless we solve certain problems in time, we are doomed. But that has always been true, and always will be. Problems are inevitable. As I said, many civilizations have fallen. Even before the dawn of civilization, all our sister species, such as the Neanderthals, became extinct through challenges with which they could easily have coped, had they known how.

21.
