Quite a sad story. It's narrated by Klara, an 'artificial friend'. Little of the near-future world is explained, you pick up hints as you go.

There are plenty of interesting ideas in here, like the societal effects of the replacement of white-collar work by machines, and the class divide made by genetically enhancing kids.

The themes are reminiscent of the film "A.I." by Spielberg, but less emotional because of Klara's internal, relatively emotionless monologue.
