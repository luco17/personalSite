I asked for this as a Christmas present. I wanted to read it because it touches on finance, maths and computing, but on finishing I realised that its really about the difficulties of building a business. It shows how Jim Simons' success depended on his ability to sell a vision, manage talent and use his contact book. Without knowing and convincing the right people, Renaissance would not have survived.

It opens with a snapshot of Renaissance before moving onto Simons' early career: PhD, Institute of Defence Analyses, head of mathematics at Stony Brook University and then founding Renaissance. Once set up, it's far from clear that it'll succeed. The PhDs he recruits trade with intuition rather than the quantitative approach Simons had envisaged. Over time, however, the firm begins to adjust. The recruitment of Sandor Straus is a key milestone, his passion for aggregating data provides the grist for the algorithms. The book goes into light detail about how they iterate and improve their strategies and is interesting if you like finance. These two bits caught my attention:

- Simons believed that the market could be beaten, this went against the Efficient Market Hypothesis, an economic model that assumed all market participants were rational 'econs' and therefore all opportunities would be quickly traded away. This contradicted the findings of behavioural economists like Tversky and Kahneman (whose work is covered in Michael Lewis's 'The Undoing Project').

- Simons combined a culture of openness and informality with excellence. He compensated staff, no matter how 'lowly' their roles. If Medallion performed, they were paid six-monthly bonuses. Great scene regarding comp with Peter Brown: when a staffer's opinion is needed at 2am, Brown picks up the phone to call him, a colleague stops him saying "you can't call him this early, he's not paid enough". Brown replies with "Fine, let's give him a raise then, but we have to call him!".

The appendix shows that since 1988 the Medallion fund has returned 66.1% pre fees on average each year and 39.1% net. Remarkable.
