This drew me in and I read it over three days. The Protagonist's story takes place when studying in late 60's Tokyo. His heart is captured by a damaged fellow student he knows from home. The origins of their relationship, her mental illness and his responsibility to her make him struggle to embrace the world. But he is functional, unlike her. He meets another student, contrasted by her humour and vibrancy, who can bring him out of his stupor. His developing relationship with her and the conflict this causes with his duty to the past creates the subtle tension that drives the plot.

The writing is extraordinarily crisp, here's an example:

> "_The October breeze set white fronds of head-high grasses swaying. One long streak of cloud hung pasted across a dome of frozen blue. It almost hurt to look at that far-off sky_"

I've read some of Murakami's short fiction and really enjoyed that. Since he has such a big back catalogue, I'm sure I'll pick up another one later this year or early next.
