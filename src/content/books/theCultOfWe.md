Great book. Like a lot of these start-up stories it has this strong narrative pull of the classic "tragedy".

What really struck me here is the interweaving of vision and story: if you have a massive vision but can't tell a compelling story, you won't get others to follow you, you won't get backing and it won't go anywhere. If you can tell a great story, you can get those things but may not be able to follow through.

A few good quotes I may include here when I go over the book again.
