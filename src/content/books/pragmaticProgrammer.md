This was lent to me by our CTO, Tom, who swears by it. I was most impressed by the authors' conviction that engineering is a very 'grey' discipline. There are no clear-cut decisions when architecting your system or choosing a stack, just a series of trade-offs to be made in light of current facts and priorities.

It also expanded on principles I'd heard of before - such as DRY (don't repeat yourself) - which helped me get a better perspective on how to adapt them for my own projects.
