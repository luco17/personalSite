A good, quick read but I got the gist of it within the first couple of chapters and then didn't learn much more. The thrust is that as Christianity went from a small, fringe religion to the mainstream (a watershed was when Emperor Constantine converted and issued the Edict of Milan in 313 AD), much of the classical world's scientific, intellectual and artistic output was destroyed.

This journey from fringe to ubiquity is fascinating in itself. It took many hundreds of years of effort. One of the best points Nixey makes is that Christians were able to dominate because they were "united" and put simply, believed more in their cause. It is an example of how focused fringe groups that are numerically inferior can upend the status quo through passion and focus.
