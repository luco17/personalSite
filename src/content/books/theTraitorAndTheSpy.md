Galloped through this in 2 days. Three things stuck with me: There is an assumed competence that intelligence organisations have, but they are hostage to human fallibility, like any other organisation; The benefits of espionage are unclear - intelligence work may not give tangible strategic advantages; and the day-to-day agent tradecraft, for example, how to 'dry clean' (lose a tail).

The final bits around Oleg escaping in the boot of a car are really extraordinary. Overall a good read, but not one I've reflected on.
