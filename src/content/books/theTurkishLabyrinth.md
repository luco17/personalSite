This book is ostensibly about the rise to power of the Refah party, an Islamist party that challenged the separation of religion and state implemented by [Atat√ºrk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk) in the 20's after he established the Republic of Turkey from the remains of the Ottoman Empire. Refah doesn't come up that much though. Instead, this history does a broad sweep of the geography and culture of the country, highlighting the difficulties of uniting disparate people, cultures and languages - a legacy of Ottoman rule - under a Turkish banner. It's beautifully written and I'll include some of the interesting phrases and passages below.

This was published in 1997 when Refah was ascendant. Refah was banned in 1998 by the Constitutional Court of Turkey after having risen to become the most popular party. [Recep Tayyip Erdogan](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)>) was a member, before leaving to found the AKP in 2001, so its legacy is still strong in today's Turkey.
