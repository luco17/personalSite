A fitness guru called Paul Chek wrote "in today's science we know more and more about less and less". Esptein's book takes up the issue and makes the case for the dabbling generalist. There's so much in here that I'll just extract the quotes and ideas I liked.

- Long-lasting learning looks inefficient. Typically you'll cram a given subject and then move onto the next one, never to return. This doesn't allow for 'spacing', a learning strategy that enhances long-term understanding.

- Human/computer combos, known as centaurs, can outperform machines and humans alone. This is because each party brings a different skill. In the humans' case, strategy and vision, in the machines' case, calculation power.

- Nobels tend to have broad interests. This allows them to fetch knowledge outside of their domains and bring it in to creatively problem solve. Think Steve Jobs and calligraphy.

- Specialization is great if your problem sets and circumstances don't change (kind problems), when they do (wicked problems), you need abstract thinking to reason your way out.

- Teaching can involve simple calculation questions - e.g. what do the angles in a pentagon add up to? - or they can involve abstract ones - does this pentagon formula apply to all polygons? In the abstract questions, a teacher will often undermine the abstract nature of the question by giving hints. The children then work out how to ask questions to get close to the answer. They are in effect, turning a conceptual problem into a procedural one.

- The average age of a founder is 45. When Zuck said that 'young-people are smarter', he was 22, it was in his interests to say so.

- There are two types of problems: kind and wicked. Kind problems - like a game of golf - have set rules and outcomes that can be controlled. Wicked problems, don't have these benefits and as such, experience or specialized knowledge counts for much less. A former Olympian preaches this by saying "The rules for life are different from the rules for sports... so when you get out there, devote your time to things that don't have a definite end goal".

- Successful problem solvers are better at identifying the structure of a problem before tackling it.

- Van Gogh had a huge range of jobs, most of them failures (as did JK Rowling). It was the failures that allowed them to find what they were good at. Had they been successful, maybe they'd have stayed in average things they didn't really enjoy. This leads to the idea of 'Match Quality' - how well people are suited to what they do. The idea of never quitting, although commendable, may restrict our ability to find what we're good at. The first avenues we try (e.g. acting, start-ups) should be high-risk high-reward and have effective feedback loops (you'll quickly work out if you ain't gonna cut it). Platitudes like 'quitters never win' may not hold true in light of this. Perhaps winners quit fast and often when they feel something isn't relevant. From this perspective knowing when to quit is the most important skill, so before starting anything hard, enumerate your conditions for quitting. Similarly, grit can manifest in some pursuits more than others. One may have it in running, but not in studying things you find boring. The hardest challenge is finding a goal with high match quality. Not quitting something you don't like is an example of the 'sunken costs' fallacy. This is why conmen demand small asks first, so that bigger ones become easier later.

- One technique to improve match quality is to focus on short-term goal setting: Here's who I am now, here are my motivations, here are the things I like to do, here's what I'd like to learn, and here are the opportunities. Which is the best match right now?

- When assessing qualities of individuals who are already highly selected, traits that are relevant for them may be totally irrelevant for others. A good example is NBA players, since they are already enormously tall (average height 6"7), height may not appear to be a significant success predictor amongst them, but when compared with all people, it's more or less the key differentiator.

- People's behaviour is dependent on their circumstances. A neurotic and overly sensitive boyfriend may be receptive to criticism at work. Similarly, grit appears in different circumstances. We should be asking _when_ people are gritty rather than _if_ they are gritty.

- People who win Kaggle comps often have no ML or domain knowledge whatsoever.

- The Gameboy is an example of outside the box thinking using old tech (same with the Wii).

- Carter Racing case study: why don't people ask for more information in assignments? Overlearned behaviours make it hard to adjust e.g. firefighters dropping their tools in a crisis.

- How to balance process vs. new ideas? You don't want to reinvent the wheel every time you have to do a project. But you don't ever want people to say "this is the way it's always been done". If you have a talking shop, where ideas are debated and discussed, how do you make sure that discussions are fruitful?

- Disease with a prevalence of 1/1000, 5% false positive, what are the odds of a positive result actually having the disease? take 10k people, 10 will have the disease (10k _ 0.001), 500 will be false positive (0.05 _ 10k), which gives a total of 510 positives, so there is only a 1.96% of actually having the disease (10 / 510).

- Don't feel that you're behind. Compare yourself to the you of yesterday, not people who aren't you. Keep experimenting and devote time to expanding your experience pool.
