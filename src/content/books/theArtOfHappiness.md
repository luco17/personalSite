I was given this by a colleague as a leaving present. I was about to start a walk across the Pyrenees [(the GR10)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_10_(France)>) and he must have thought it was as good a time as any for a reflection on happiness. I didn't manage to start it until 18 months later, but once I got going I read it in two weeks.

The book is written in an interview format, with each chapter framed with Cutler sitting down with the Dalai Lama to ask a question about happiness and the human condition. The Dalai Lama's replies are thought provoking and after the ideas are explored more often than not Cutler digs up some scientific evidence to back up the DL's assumptions. This last bit is where I found the book weakest, although my scepticism has been prompted because of reproducibility issues in much psychology research.

Several bits of it stuck with me and I hope to be able to apply them going forward. I've outlined these below:

- The purpose of life is to seek happiness; but if that's so, is it self-centred to do so? Maybe not, since happier people are likely to be more engaged and kinder to others

- Changing the way you act, react and interact requires mental training, much like physical changes require changing. Meditation, prayer and practice interactions are all training.

- Along the same lines as above, there is no silver bullet for happiness. You will need a variety of tools to overcome situations that challenge your happiness, in much the same way as a healthy body requires sleep, nutrition, exercise, environment etc.

- When training the mind, start the day positive and at the end, review it and see what you didn't do so well.

- The decline of religion and a lack of a clear code of secular ethics to replace it has contributed to a loss of understanding about what leading a 'wholesome' life involves.

- The human nature is fundamentally gentle and compassionate. This contrasts with a Western psychological view, which tends to view humans as selfish and violent.

- Relating to people on the fundamental similarities we have with them (we are both human) and focusing on their good characteristics allows the Dalai Lama to approach them with compassion. People expect the other person to respond to them in a positive way first.

- We like to view ourselves as independent; those dependent on others can get looked down on. But the whole of society is dependent on the works of other humans. Even a pair of socks require a massive supply chain to get to your feet, from the cotton-picker, to the truck driver, to the machine operator at the garment factory and so on down the chain. Self-reliance is an illusion.

- Intimacy with 'one special person' is prized in the West. In eastern cultures intimacy is viewed as less passionate and can be shared with friends and family, leading to less disillusionment when 1-2-1 relationships crumble. At the same time, if you are limited to achieving intimacy with a romantic partner then you miss opportunities at gaining intimacy in other aspects of your life.

- Difficult stuff about what to look for in a partner. DL emphasises that the basis of the relationship should be solid, not merely based on looks or passion. He goes further, viewing romance as a fantasy and undoubtedly negative.

- Some love is based on attachment: wanting to love someone so that they love you back, or so you can have some sense of control over them. Anything based on that will come unstuck as your compassion for them is dependent on external factors. The second kind is based on mutual respect for each other as humans.

- If you are wealthy and successful people may be relating to you in the context of your wealth and success, rather than your actual nature. Were the fortune to go, the basis of the relationship could decline. If you have compassion, even if you have economic problems, you can fall back on it as your tool for relating with people.

- There are many more things in life that cause feelings of suffering and dissatisfaction. There are relatively fewer that cause feeling of joy and elation. Trying to avoid suffering at all costs is not necessarily an effective strategy. We are less tolerant of it in the West. In developing countries it is much more visible. The elderly aren't shipped off to nursing homes, they remain in the community, cared for by all.

- Personalizing petty injustices is stupid but quite common (e.g. slow service at a restaurant). Thinking of yourself as the center of the world, suffering alone, is a mistake.

- Nothing exists in a permanent condition, nothing is able to remain the same under its own independent power. No matter how pleasant or pleasurable your experience may be, it will not last.

- Enemies are the ultimate spiritual development tool. Without them, you cannot practice developing compassion.

- Our ultimate aim in seeking more wealth is a sense of satisfaction, of happiness. The very basis of seeking more is a feeling of not having enough, a feeling of discontentment.

- The essential ingredients to happiness are determination, effort and time. The Dalai Lama's teaching emphasise achieving happiness through reasoning and training the mind, rather than faith.

- When confronted with aggression, humility involves having the capacity to take a confrontational stance, yet deciding not to. If you are passive out of helplessness or incapacitation, that is not the same.

- If you approach tasks with sincere motivation, you will be less daunted by them. An example is chatting up a girl. If you are doing it out of a desire to meet a partner to start a family with, then that is not something to be ashamed of, go and talk to her.

- People fundamentally love themselves, even the suicidal are doing so out of a desire to end their suffering.
