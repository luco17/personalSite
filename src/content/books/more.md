Philip Coggan is a former FT journalist who now writes for the Economist. I read a previous book of his, The Money Machine, which is a good primer on global finance. He does a similar thing for economic history in this book. The sweep is enormous and reminds me in parts of Sapiens by Harari, but with less of the musing about the nature of humans.

There are a ton of interesting ideas in there that I'll bullet below when I get the time.
