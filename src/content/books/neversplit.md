1. Use the other party's name(s)
2. "Calibrated questions - Open ended. Give illusion of control but have no fixed answers."
3. "Getting to yes" was based on ideas of 'homo economicus', Kahneman and Tversky knew these models of rationality did not hold up to reality.
4. "Listening demonstrates empathy and a clear desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing." I'm reminded of my failures in a youth club. My instinct was to give orders to the kids or tell them off "You shouldn't litter", etc. This guy came in who'd done time in Morocco for smuggling and he instantly had some connection with them. "Why'd you shout at your brother like that?" He'd ask, and the kid would respond. Inspiring to see.
5. Form some hypotheses before going in. Update these in light of what you're learning.
6. Related to the above - don't be so smart you think you have nothing to discover. n.b. Cummings's ideas on how elites are much the easiest to fool.
7. "When we enter a room with a level of comfort and enthusiasm, we attract people towards us."
8. "We don't do work-for-hire." Late-night FM DJ voice. Plain, simple, friendly, not up for further discussion. "You can be very direct and to the point as long as you create safety by a tone of voice that says I’m okay, you're okay, let's figure things out."
9. "I always try to reinforce the message that being right isn’t the key to a successful negotiation — having the right mindset is."
10. "Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they've said. They will never say it exactly the same way they said it the first time. Ask someone, 'What do you mean by that?' and you're likely to incite irritation or defensiveness. A mirror, however, will get you the clarity you want while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying."
11. "Most of us enter verbal combat unlikely to persuade anyone of anything because we only know and care about our own goals and perspective."
12. Labelling is an effective tool for demonstrating tactical empathy.
13. Open labelling discussions with "It seems like..., it sounds like..., it looks like...". Notice the absence of "I", it gets people's guard up.
14. I remember something from a 30 Minutes to President's Club podcast about saying things like "I'm not the smartest dude in the room here so could you do me a favour and explain..." Need to track it down.
15. Accusation audit - list every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you (Eminem does this in the final rap battle in 8 Mile!)
16. Put yourself in their shoes before any discussion (closely tied to 'accusation audit'.)
17. Giving people permission to say 'no' preserves their deep need for autonomy. As such, it is a useful starting point for negotiations.
18. Negotiators gain power by "understanding their counterpart's situation and extracting information about their counterpart's desires and needs. Extracting that information means getting the other party to feel safe and in control." Hence the power of getting them to say 'no'.
19. Slow = in control.
