      Welcome! I work on software products from a bunch of different angles but
      principally as a product owner. To do this well I spend plenty of time on
      web dev, data analytics, product design and understanding users. I split
      my product work with the administrative duties of being the COO at a
      defence tech SME.

      My most significant professional milestone has been co-founding <a
        href="https://squaddy.app">Squaddy</a
      > with my good friend Tom. I learnt a lot form doing this and have written
      a bit about it <a href="/posts" data-astro-prefetch>here</a>. Squaddy is
      sunsetting now that we've moved onto new projects. We're currently helping
      build <a href="https://cloudsecure.ltd">CloudSecure</a>.
